## 🔄 Workflow Patterns

### Daily Development Flow
1. Load: `@CLAUDE.md`
2. Check: `@.claude/context/health/dashboard.md`
3. Work: Update relevant agent contexts as you go
4. Before break: `/smart-clear`

### Feature Development Flow
1. Start: `/feature feature-name mode`
2. Plan: Update all 4 agent contexts with feature-specific analysis
3. Develop: Track progress in session files  
4. Review: `/review feature` with all agents
5. Complete: Update health dashboard

### Problem Solving Flow
1. Define: `/collaborate problem-solving "description"`
2. Analyze: Get input from relevant agents
3. Decide: Document decision in collaboration session
4. Update: Modify agent contexts with outcomes

### Weekly Health Flow  
1. Assess: `/health` - complete assessment template
2. Update: Refresh dashboard with current status
3. Plan: Identify improvement priorities
4. Track: Note trends and progress
