"""
Strong Foundation

  Realistic Scope: Unlike the platform PRD's ambitious orchestration plans, this focuses on a well-defined problem: getting data from point A (Hugging Face/local) to
   point B (standardized format for SAE training). This is achievable.

  Clear Integration Strategy: The explicit "Lead-In" section showing how it fits with the platform layer demonstrates good systems thinking. The manifest-based
  handoff to SAE training is smart.

  Concrete Technical Details: The API payload examples and CLI commands make this feel implementable rather than theoretical.

  Practical Strengths

  User-Centric Design: The step-by-step workflows (Hugging Face vs local dataset) address real user needs. The validation + tailoring + manifest flow makes sense.

  Security Conscious: Proper credential management for Hugging Face tokens, local data privacy, and audit trails show production readiness thinking.

  Extensible Architecture: The modular loader/tailoring interfaces suggest thoughtful design for future data sources.

  Areas of Concern

  Timeline Optimism: Even focused on data prep, this still includes web UI, comprehensive observability, role-based access controls, and multi-format validation.
  That's closer to 4-8 weeks for a production system.

  Resource Constraints Glossed Over: For Jetson deployment, what happens when someone tries to ingest a 50GB dataset? The "streaming and chunking" mention needs more
   thought.Please 

  Validation Complexity Underestimated: "Schema validation for diverse data schemas" is harder than it sounds - especially for arbitrary local uploads.

  Missing Elements

  Data Format Reality: What about CSV with weird encodings? Parquet files? Multi-modal datasets? The "no support for non-standard formats" non-goal might be too
  limiting.

  Error Recovery: What happens when Hugging Face download fails halfway through? Jetson loses network mid-process?

  Performance Expectations: No mention of throughput targets or processing time estimates for different dataset sizes.

  Overall Assessment

  This is the most implementable PRD of the three. The core value proposition (standardized data prep with manifest tracking) directly supports the interpretability
  workflow. The technical approach is sound.

  Recommendation: Start with Phase 1 (ingestion/validation) as an MVP. Defer the web UI and advanced observability until you have users validating the core workflow.
   The manifest-based handoff design is excellent - that's your key innovation here.
