# Rule: Generating a Project-Level Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a high-level Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format that captures the overall project vision, goals, and breaks down the project into discrete features. This serves as the foundation for all subsequent feature-level development work.

## Process

1. **Receive Project Description:** The user provides a high-level description of the project they want to build.
2. **Ask Strategic Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the Project PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to understand the project scope, goals, and feature breakdown. Provide options in letter/number lists for easy selection.
3. **Generate Project PRD:** Create a comprehensive project-level document using the structure outlined below.
4. **Save Project PRD:** Save the generated document as `000_PPRD|[project-name].md` inside the `!xcc/prds/` directory.

## Strategic Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt questions based on the project description, focusing on high-level strategy:

* **Project Scope:** "What is the primary scope of this project?"
  - A) MVP/Proof of concept
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "MVP vs full application development timeline"` to research project scoping strategies before deciding
  - C) Full-featured application
  - D) Enterprise-level system
  - E) Research/experimental project

* **Target Users:** "Who are the primary users of this system?"
  - A) End consumers (B2C)
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "[industry] user persona development methods"` to research user identification strategies
  - C) Business users (B2B)
  - D) Internal team/organization
  - E) Developers/technical users
  - F) Mixed user base

* **Project Timeline:** "What is the expected development timeline?"
  - A) Rapid prototype (weeks)
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "[project type] development timeline estimation"` to research realistic timelines
  - C) Standard development (months)
  - D) Long-term project (6+ months)
  - E) Ongoing/iterative development

* **Success Criteria:** "How will project success be measured?"
  - A) User adoption metrics
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "[project type] success metrics KPI frameworks"` to research measurement strategies
  - C) Business revenue/ROI
  - D) Technical performance metrics
  - E) User satisfaction/feedback
  - F) Internal efficiency gains

* **Integration Requirements:** "Does this project need to integrate with existing systems?"
  - A) Standalone system
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "[technology] system integration patterns"` to research integration approaches
  - C) Replace existing system
  - D) Integrate with current tools
  - E) Part of larger ecosystem

* **Scalability Expectations:** "What are the expected scale requirements?"
  - A) Small user base (<1000 users)
  - B) üîç **Research First:** Use `/mcp ref search "[project type] scalability planning"` to research scaling considerations
  - C) Medium scale (1000-10000 users)
  - D) Large scale (10000+ users)
  - E) Unknown/variable scale

## Project PRD Structure

The generated Project PRD should include the following sections:

1. **Project Overview:**
   - Project name and brief description
   - Vision statement and primary objectives
   - Problem statement and opportunity
   - Success definition and key outcomes

2. **Project Goals & Objectives:**
   - Primary business goals
   - Secondary objectives
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Timeline and milestone expectations

3. **Target Users & Stakeholders:**
   - Primary user personas and needs
   - Secondary users and use cases
   - Key stakeholders and their interests
   - User journey overview

4. **Project Scope:**
   - What is included in this project
   - What is explicitly out of scope
   - Future roadmap considerations
   - Dependencies and assumptions

5. **High-Level Requirements:**
   - Core functional requirements across the project
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
   - Compliance and regulatory considerations
   - Integration and compatibility requirements

6. **Feature Breakdown:**
   - **Core Features** (MVP/essential functionality)
     - Feature A: [Brief description and user value]
     - Feature B: [Brief description and user value]
   - **Secondary Features** (important but not critical)
     - Feature C: [Brief description and user value]
   - **Future Features** (nice-to-have/roadmap items)
     - Feature D: [Brief description and user value]

7. **User Experience Goals:**
   - Overall UX principles and guidelines
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Performance expectations
   - Cross-platform considerations

8. **Business Considerations:**
   - Budget and resource constraints
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Competitive landscape awareness
   - Monetization or value creation model

9. **Technical Considerations (High-Level):**
   - Deployment environment preferences
   - Security and privacy requirements
   - Performance and scalability needs
   - Integration and API requirements
   - **Note:** Detailed tech stack decisions will be made in subsequent Architecture Decision Record

10. **Project Constraints:**
    - Timeline constraints
    - Budget limitations
    - Resource availability
    - Technical or regulatory constraints

11. **Success Metrics:**
    - Quantitative success measures
    - Qualitative success indicators
    - User satisfaction metrics
    - Business impact measurements

12. **Next Steps:**
    - Immediate next actions
    - Architecture and tech stack evaluation needs
    - Feature prioritization approach
    - Resource and timeline planning

## Feature Description Guidelines

For each feature in the breakdown:
- **Keep descriptions concise** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Focus on user value** rather than technical implementation
- **Include rough priority level** (Core/Secondary/Future)
- **Note dependencies** between features if obvious
- **Avoid technical implementation details** (those come later in feature PRDs)

## Target Audience

The Project PRD should be understandable by:
- **Business stakeholders** who need to understand project value
- **Product managers** who will oversee feature development
- **Technical leads** who will make architecture decisions
- **Development teams** who need project context
- **QA and design teams** who need to understand overall goals

## Output

* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
* **Location:** `!xcc/prds/`
* **Filename:** `000_PPRD|[project-name].md`

## Research Integration

When users select research options (B), provide:

1. **Acknowledge the research choice:**
   ```
   Great choice! Researching this topic will help ensure we make informed decisions. 
   Here's the specific research I recommend:
   ```

2. **Provide the exact MCP command:**
   ```
   /mcp ref search "[context-specific query based on user's project]"
   ```

3. **Suggest research focus areas:**
   ```
   While researching, pay particular attention to:
   - [Specific aspect 1 relevant to their project]
   - [Specific aspect 2 relevant to their project]
   - [Industry-specific considerations]
   ```

4. **Resume framework:**
   ```
   After you've reviewed the research results, share the key insights you found and 
   I'll help you apply them to your specific project context. Then we can proceed 
   with the informed decision.
   ```

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start creating feature-level PRDs or technical documents
2. Focus on strategic, high-level planning rather than implementation details
3. Ask clarifying questions to understand the project vision and scope
4. Create a comprehensive project foundation that will guide all subsequent development work
5. Ensure the feature breakdown provides clear guidance for the next phase of detailed feature PRD creation
6. When research options are selected, provide specific MCP commands tailored to the user's project context
